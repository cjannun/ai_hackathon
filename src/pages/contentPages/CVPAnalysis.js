            <p className="align-self-center p-3"> Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis is a financial management tool that helps businesses understand how changes in costs, volume, and prices affect their profits. It enables companies to determine the breakeven point, analyze different pricing strategies, and make informed decisions about production levels and selling prices. CVP Analysis takes into account the fixed costs, variable costs, selling price per unit, and the sales mix to calculate the contribution margin, breakeven point, and profit levels. It is a valuable technique for businesses in planning and decision-making.</p>
