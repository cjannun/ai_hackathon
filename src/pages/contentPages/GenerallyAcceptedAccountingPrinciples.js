            <h5 className="align-self-center mt-0"> Overview of GAAP </h5>
            <p className="align-self-center p-3"> Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are a set of standard accounting guidelines and procedures used in the United States to ensure consistency and accuracy in financial reporting. GAAP provides a framework for companies to record, summarize, and present their financial information in a reliable and transparent manner.
                <br /><br />
                GAAP covers a wide range of accounting topics, including revenue recognition, expense recognition, asset valuation, and financial statement presentation. These principles are designed to provide relevant and reliable information to investors, creditors, and other stakeholders for decision-making purposes.
                <br /><br />
                Some key concepts of GAAP include the accrual basis of accounting, which requires revenue and expenses to be recognized when earned or incurred, regardless of when cash is received or paid. GAAP also emphasizes the importance of consistency and comparability, ensuring that financial statements can be analyzed and compared across different time periods and companies.
                <br /><br />
                Compliance with GAAP is essential for businesses to accurately report their financial performance and position. It helps ensure transparency, reduces the risk of fraud, and enhances the credibility of financial statements. Companies that do not adhere to GAAP may face legal and regulatory consequences.
