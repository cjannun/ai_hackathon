            <p className="align-self-center p-3">
            Financial statements are essential documents that summarize a company's financial activities and performance for both internal and external stakeholders. There are four main types of financial statements: the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity.
<br></br>
The balance sheet offers a snapshot of the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time, helping stakeholders understand its financial position and ability to meet obligations. The income statement reveals revenues, expenses, and net profit or loss over a specific period, aiding in evaluating profitability and performance. The cash flow statement reports cash inflows and outflows, shedding light on how the company generates and uses cash, including operating, investing, and financing activities. The statement of changes in equity shows alterations in shareholders' equity over a specific period.
<br></br>
These financial statements collectively provide a comprehensive view of a company's financial performance, liquidity, solvency, and shareholder value. They adhere to accounting standards (GAAP or IFRS) for consistency and comparability and are often audited for reliability and credibility. They are crucial for investors, lenders, regulators, and other stakeholders in assessing a company's financial health and viability. However, it's important to use financial statements in conjunction with other tools and indicators for a complete understanding of a company's financial situation. In summary, financial statements are vital for stakeholders to make informed decisions and assess a company's financial health, performance, and ability to meet its obligations.
