            <p className="align-self-center p-3"> Internal auditing is a process in which an organization's internal auditors examine and evaluate its financial statements, internal controls, and overall operational performance. The main objective of internal auditing is to provide independent and objective assurance to the organization's management and stakeholders that its operations are carried out effectively and efficiently, and that risks are appropriately managed. Internal auditors assess risks, review processes and procedures, identify weaknesses, provide recommendations for improvement, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations. By conducting regular internal audits, organizations can enhance their control environment, identify areas for process improvement, and identify and mitigate potential risks. </p>
