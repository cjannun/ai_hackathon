            <p className="align-self-center p-3"> Auditing is the process of examining and evaluating the financial records, statements, and operations of a business to ensure their accuracy, integrity, and compliance with regulations. It involves the systematic analysis of financial transactions, internal controls, and risk management processes to provide an independent and objective assessment of an organization's financial health and performance. Auditing plays a crucial role in maintaining transparency, accountability, and trust in financial reporting. It helps identify any discrepancies, errors, or potential fraud, and provides recommendations for improvement. Auditors use various techniques, such as sampling, verification, and analytical procedures, to gather evidence and form an opinion about the fairness and reliability of financial statements. Overall, auditing serves as a critical tool in ensuring the reliability and credibility of financial information for stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and regulatory authorities. </p>
