                Individual taxes refer to the taxes that an individual taxpayer is responsible for paying to the government based on their income, investments, and other financial activities. These taxes are collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States.

                The primary type of individual tax is income tax, which is based on an individual's annual income. The tax rates for income tax vary depending on the individual's income level and filing status. It is important for individuals to understand their tax brackets and the deductions and credits they may be eligible for to minimize their tax liability.

                In addition to income tax, individuals may also be responsible for paying other taxes such as self-employment tax, capital gains tax, and estate tax, depending on their financial situation. It is crucial for taxpayers to accurately report their income and deductions to ensure they are compliant with tax laws.

                Understanding individual taxes is essential for individuals to fulfill their tax obligations and avoid penalties. It is advisable to seek professional tax advice or use tax preparation software to accurately calculate and file your taxes.
